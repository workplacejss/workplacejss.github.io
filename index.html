    „Works and Days”<br>
    Interactive Installation<br>
    Speakers, wire, single board computer, field recordings, ultrasonic sensors<br>
    2024<br>
    200x180x60cm
</p>
        <p>Field recordings captured across Italy and Greece are diffused through clusters of mini speakers creating three “Swarms.” Various cicada audios positioned around a central speaker that echoes city sounds: the rumble of construction, the murmur of distant voices, the steady thrum of traffic. As visitors move through the space, PIR sensors track movement, and a Raspberry Pi microprocessor running code subtly amplifies the closest “Swarm,” while quieting others. This interplay invites the viewer into a sensation of being both observed and absorbed by the sounds of industry and nature around them. Conceptualized while listening to meditative works by John Cage and Alice Coltrane. This installation draws one into a meditative state, encouraging one to bask in the sonic layers of a living code of calls, hums, and unseen rhythms that make up the fabric of our daily lives.</p>

            Interactive Installation<br>
           PIR sensor, wire, single board computer, felted wool blanket<br>

        </p>
        <p>Shrouded beneath a layer of felted wool, an unseen being stirs, its movements manipulating the fabric’s surface in a rhythmic struggle. Powered by a single board computer running code and activated by a PIR sensor, the sculpture reacts to the presence of the observer. Claustrophilia delves into the psychological tension between comfort and confined space. While the being inside may be content, this kinetic installation invites viewers to confront this perspective as an onlooker, provoking an instinct to either intervene or retreat. “Claustrum” prompts reflection on the boundaries between the animate and inanimate, comfort and disquiet, intimacy and alienation.</p>

            Interactive Installation<br>

        <p>ELIZA explores the building blocks of human language in a form that invites viewers to grapple with meaning—or its absence. The installation utilizes a Raspberry Pi microcontroller running code, an independent power source, wires, speakers, and infrared sensors that detect viewer proximity, all housed in a molded fiberglass shell. As visitors approach the vessel, the sensors measure the distance of the viewer and trigger audio recordings measured out to specific intervals—nasal hums, guttural clicks, and soft approximates—recited by classical musician William Socolof who was commissioned for this work.This fragmented vocalization evokes a digital theremin of human sound—precise but devoid of syntax or semantics. These phonemes are divorced from the context and grammar that typically give them purpose. Drawing inspiration from Peter Ladefoged’s phonetic studies and the “ELIZA effect” coined by Joseph Weizenbaum, the piece challenges the viewer’s impulse to interpret, to imbue sounds with meaning even when none is given. In this void, ELIZA  questions our innate desire to find coherence, especially in an era of AI and deep learning where the line between human and machine language blurs. ELIZA  becomes an introspective experience, prompting viewers to confront the elemental DNA of their language—disembodied, raw, and eerily familiar.</p>

        <p>Body in Flux explores the relationship between the human body and societal structures that shape it. The sculpture runs via a motor powered by an external source embedded under the seat of the chair which circulates the liquid in the veins throughout the piece. The chair has been infiltrated by an external system of veins, skin, pumps and motors. The parasitic force not only embraces but embodies the form—not an idealized form, but a necessary conduit for its existence. These elements give rise to a new entity that blurs the boundaries between the innate and the constructed. It mirrors the constant flux of identity—changing, evolving, and adapting in response to external stimuli. As the chair assumes the role of both form and metaphor, it becomes an unsettling companion, challenging the viewer to confront their own self-conscious identity shaped by the cycle of perception, reaction, and change.</p>

            „Nepenthe” <br>
            Digital Maquette <br>
            2025
        </p>
        <p>Nepenthe—a genus of carnivorous plants whose passive yet inescapable traps I parallel to social media’s algorithmic pull. A translucent sculptural pitcher plant houses a screen looping YouTube Shorts curated solely by U.S. location-based recommendations, highlighting how engagement-driven algorithms shape ideology and identity. <br> <br> Engagement-optimized feedback loops amplify divisive content without intent, commodifying attention and emotional response. Nepenthe doesn’t advocate censorship but reveals the biases embedded in supposedly neutral systems. By immersing viewers in algorithmically generated content, the piece exposes how media consumption both defines and consumes us. Through participation, viewers complete the work—engaging with a system that reflects and critiques digital consumption. Nepenthe invites us to confront the unseen forces shaping our digital reality, implicating both algorithm and user in perpetual engagement. <br> <br> Data Collection: A YouTube Shorts account will be created using a VPN and private browser, isolating geographic-based recommendations. Screen recordings will analyze content trends and ideological bias. <br> <br>  Physical Installation: A transparent sculptural pitcher plant, vacuum-molded from polycarbonate or recycled plastics, large enough for a viewer to peer inside. <br> <br> Embedded Technology: A looping screen with speakers; internal mechanics (Raspberry Pi, wiring) submerged in mineral oil, mimicking digestive fluids and reinforcing passive entrapment.
